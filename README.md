-   If your computer doesn't want to download the files, find buttons that say 'Keep', and keep pressing them. Some are shown below:

-   Run the file
-   When Windows refuses to run it, click on the more info button (This didn't pop up when I was grabbing screenshots, but is fairly straightforward).

-   Enjoy
